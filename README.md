# CO-Project

Designed and implemented a custom assembler and simulator for a 16-bit ISA with various instructions like addition, subtraction, move, load, store, multiply, divide, shift, logical operations, comparisons, and jumps. The assembler converted assembly code to binary machine code for the ISA. It handled instruction formats, labels, variables, and error handling.
The simulator executed the binary code, simulating the ISA components like Memory, Program Counter, Register File, and Execution Engine. It printed the state after each instruction and the memory dump after halting. The project provided hands-on experience in designing system software components like assemblers and simulators for a custom ISA specification, handling binary encoding, and extending functionality.
